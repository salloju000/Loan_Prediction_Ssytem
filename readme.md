## 🧠 Project Description

This Loan Prediction System uses historical loan application data to predict whether a loan should be approved or not. It simplifies the loan approval process by automatically evaluating eligibility based on factors like income, credit history, dependents, and more.

The model is trained using supervised machine learning techniques, and the application provides a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
